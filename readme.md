# Jackson's Simple Bash Scripts

This is a collection of very basic bash scripts to speed up certain repetitive tasks.

## Directory

**`newreact.sh`**: Creates a new React project on the desktop from my react-starter, installs needed dependenies, and opens vscode for a rapid start to a new React project.

**`opensnippets-osx.sh` (OSX)**: A very simple script to open the VSCode User Snippets folder on a machine running OSX, because I can't ever remember the path.

**`opensnippets-ubuntu.sh` (Ubuntu)**: A duplicate of the script above, though for Ubuntu filesystem.

**`sync-snippets`** Navigates to VSCode user snippets directory and pulls from
master. If directory doesn't exist, it is automatically created and pulls from
master. 

**`folderized_comp.sh`**: A script for creating a folderized react component structure.
