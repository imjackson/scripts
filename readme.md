# Jackson's Simple Bash Scripts

This is a collection of very basic bash scripts to speed up certain repetitive tasks.

## Directory

**`newreact.sh`**: Creates a new React project on the desktop from my react-starter, installs needed dependenies, and opens vscode for a rapid start to a new React project.

**`opensnippets.sh`**: A very simple script to open the VSCode User Snippets folder, because I can't ever remember the path.

**`folderized_comp.sh`**: A script for creating a folderized react component structure.
